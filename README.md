# config_files

This repo keeps a record of the paths of configuration files and the content of files.

## MAC

* hosts: "/etc/hosts"
* vimrc: "/usr/share/vim/vimrc"
* .zshrc: "./~"
* .bashrc: "./~"

## Ubuntu 14.04

* Mysql: the default path is "/etc/mysql/my.cnf". But if customized the configs, fill to "/etc/mysql/conf.d/*.cnf". Any file name ending with ".cnf" will override the configuration in /etc/mysql/my.cnf.
* vimrc: "~/.vimrc"
